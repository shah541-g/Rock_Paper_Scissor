# Rock_Paper_Scissor
This is another practice of my Day 1. A terminal based Rock, Paper and scissor game. Play with computer ðŸ’»

> **How the code actually works:**
1) I have used time and random modules in this project
2) time module for seeding random with the current second.
3) random module is used to get a random choice for computer.
4) a _draw function_ is for drawing the hand gestures based on the player's choice
5) _notify function_ is for notifying the choice of both the player and the computer
6) If, else conditions are managed based on the all losing possiblities and just one winning possibility
7) any sort of exception will be handled by _try except_

> **How to run the code:**
For running the code you have to follow the following steps:
1) Just provide the input according to the specifications,
2)  0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissor

> **Exceptions:**
1) For any character or string a simple statement will be printed i.e _an error occured_
2) For any number outside the range same simple statement will be printed i.e _an error occured_
